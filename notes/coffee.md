Coffee is water with whatever we manage to extract from coffee beans. Here I try to structure my thoughts

## What is our liking?

### Kind of coffee drink

There's a plethora of words describing a specific _kind_ of coffee. Many of them base on espresso. Some notable
mentions:

- Doppio: A double shot of espresso
- Cappuccino: Espresso with steamed milk and foam
- Flat White: Espresso with milk foam
- Americano: Espresso and hot water

To adjust the coffee-related flavors in those drinks we need to break down the process of making espresso.

### Coffee-related flavors

A key taste spectrum ranges from sour over "balanced" to bitter. The interesting part is, that where we land on this
spectrum heavily relies on process factors. We will dive into this later. For now, we note, that we can adjust it.

#### Beans

The beans are the basis of any coffee and determine the coffee taste. Here, I'm trying to dive into the process
independent of them. Most often, one can only start exploring the full flavor set of a bean bag after having determined
the right process parameters.
As they oxidize the only requirement is the usage of fresh beans (1-8 weeks after the roast date), which are to be
ground at a maximum of a few minutes before pulling the espresso.

## Espresso

What differentiates espresso from other coffee-brewing methods is that the nearly boiling water is forced through the
coffee grounds under high pressures (6-9 bar). As a result of the high pressure difference with the atmosphere, the
coffee gets a characteristic *crema* (foam) on top.

### Process Parameters

**Coffee machine controllable**: Water temperature, pressure, duration.  
**Preparation**: Coffee puck.

The ideal machine mostly helps you by keeping its process parameters constant, so that you know the change in taste is
due to the parameter change you chose to do. Generally, if you are starting the journey, I would not worry about it.
Most machines bring water at around the desired ~93-degree temperature and maintain pressures above 6 bar. I started my
journey with a [fully manual espresso maker](https://www.rok.coffee/espressogc) where you pour boiling water on top and
managed to get great espresso.
That being said, for most machines water temperatures and pressures do vary throughout a shot and also from shot to
shot.

#### Coffee Puck

The puck is where I believe to find most of the espresso-magic.
Key parameters are:

- Coarseness of the coffee grind
- Amount of coffee


## Backlog

If we adjust our espresso-making process in time we can utilize two more fancy coffee words:

- Lungo: An espresso pulled over a longer duration
- Ristretto: An espresso pulled over a shorter duration.

Espresso, Bialetti, French press

Order of importance for "good" coffee (Using whole beans, fresh beans, settings/skill, grinder, machine)
