Using apps and websites in a fashion that reflects my values is tricky.

## General thoughts and inspirations
- I want to incorporate artificial barriers between me and my bad habits. [Atomic Habits, James Clear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits). Highly recommend the book.
- Social media usage comes at a cost higher than we often admit to ourselves. Fulfillment and value are found in deep work. [Deep Work, Cal Newport](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work)
- Abstinence is easier than moderation. Phones or food are hard to abstain from. Self-binding strategies acknowledge 
  the limitations of will and create barriers between compulsion and action. [Dopamine Nation, Anna Lembke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55723020-dopamine-nation)

## My Systems
### Tracking Progress
First, I was looking for data to evaluate my behavior honestly. I find it hard to estimate how much time I am spending on which website or how often I revert to opening Strava.
[RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) helps track the time spent across all devices and platforms. I believe it's important to have it running on all devices.
I reevaluate how well my systems and habits are working based on this data.

### Computer
I decided to treat my new laptop as a bad-habit-free device. Thus, I am not logged into Netflix, or most social media and only allow myself to watch educational YouTube clips. I don't need any capacity to evaluate what's allowed, and what isn't since the rules are strict and simple. To maintain that, it's important to not start cheating and open the lee-way.
If I want to consume addictive content, I'll have to use my old laptop.
To enforce such rules, install [LeechBlock](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/).

### Phone (Android)
Controlling phone usage has been more tricky. I want to use instant messaging and _some_ social media there.  
The phone is also always with me in some dull moments at the bus stop. There, I tend to default to pulling it out. I 
aim to avoid doing that as reflex.

Targets:
- Opening an app should be conscious decision and not a reflex.
- Social Media consumption is within a maximum of 15 minutes per day.


[Stay Focused](https://www.stayfocused.me/) helps me getting to that stage by allowing to:
- Group apps
- Apply restrictions on the groups
	- Maximum daily usage duration
	- Blocked time ranges
	- Amount of app launches
- Permanently show today's usage time and the amount of screen unlocks

Using the night mode of the system settings, the OS turns to grayscale from 21:30 until 07:00 to further incentivize routines without the phone around bedtime. In the evening to wind down, and in the morning to start the day on a positive-productive note.
