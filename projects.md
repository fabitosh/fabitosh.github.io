## Configuration Synchronization
Ever spent hours setting up a new machine, trying to remember all your tools and tweaks? Yeah, me too.

This project gets me from "fresh install" to "feeling at home" in minutes.

What's automated and synchronised:
- Dotfiles and configs (`.zshrc`, `.gitconfig`, etc.)
- Terminal packages
- GUI applications

One command. Three operating systems. Done.

## chat-analyzer

Instant messagers are not always my friend. I generally prefer exchanging in person, but see the necessity and value of
IMs. At times, I get overwhelmed by the messages I should reply to or want to craft. In order to understand my problem
better (and because it seemed like a cool project), I started looking into my chat data.
