## chat-analyzer

Instant messagers are not always my friend. I generally prefer exchanging in person, but see the necessity and value of
IMs. At times, I get overwhelmed by the messages I should reply to or want to craft. In order to understand my problem
better (and because it seemed like a cool project), I started looking into my chat data.
