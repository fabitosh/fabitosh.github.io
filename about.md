# About
Issa me, Fabio.
I'm not Italian, my parents only like Italian food and the name.

I like the idea of sharing knowledge.
Knowing someone else might benefit in some form helps me refining whatever I am doing a bit further.
Writing helps me get clarity in general.
I have started appreciating the skill of writing clearly more and would like to improve the craft.
Thus, this blog was born.


By trade, I am a bit of a weird mix of Roboticist, Software Engineer, Data Scientist and Mechanical Engineer.
At [Sensirion Connected Solutions](https://sensirion-connected.com/), I am responsible for scaling our algorithms into a stable product.
Which is rapidly growing in demand.
We are detecting and estimating methane leakages in turbulent wind conditions with a minimal set of IoT sensor nodes and ... wind data.

Previously I've been in charge of designing the first two iterations of the fusion modules at [9T Labs](https://www.9tlabs.com/).
A fusion module is basically a thermal press, that refines the uniquely 3D printed carbon fiber parts.
This allows for some very cool parts.

Even further back, the passion for engineering has been fully ignited during my time at [AMZ Racing](https://amzracing.ch/en), where we built an electric racecar and two years later made it run [autonomously](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKLE7uar9Y).


I encourage you telling me when you think I am wrong. Please do that instead of silently judging. Maybe we both grow.


Photography is a neat hobby. I recently shot my first wedding and enjoyed the intensity of it. If you have a cool event, which you'd like me to capture, please reach out.
